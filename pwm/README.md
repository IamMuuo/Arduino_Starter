#   Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

## Description
PWM can be used to create the illusion
of an LED being on at different levels of brightness by turning the LED on and off
rapidly, at around 500 cycles per second. The brightness we perceive is determined by
the amount of time the digital output pin is on versus the amount of time it is off—that
is, every time the LED is lit or unlit. Because our eyes can’t see flickers faster than 50
cycles per second, the LED appears to have a constant brightness.


## Pins supported by the arduino for pwm
